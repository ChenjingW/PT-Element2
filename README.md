In my personal project, I extended the theme of the team project to include the homeless and created a campaign to focus on the stories behind the homeless, with a focus on the potential discrimination and human rights violations suffered by the homeless, and to create a platform to give the homeless a voice as a protagonist and influence the content, and to create dynamic elements to be published or used in subsequent online events and social media.
